# Masrofi مصروفي
Masrofi is a personal expense tracking web application built with Laravel. It's the predecessor of [MasrofiSimple](https://github.com/CuzImAzizx/MasrofiSimple).

## Problem statement
I started this as a personal project to solve a problem I had. That is I get a transfer with amount X and it's only for groceries. So every time I buy groceries with my account, I take the SMS transaction message and put it in the app. To differentiate the grocery expenses from my personal expenses. It would've been easier to open a second bank account for free and track my grocery expenses there, but that wouldn't be fun would it?


## What have been improved?
Compared to [MasrofiSimple](https://github.com/CuzImAzizx/MasrofiSimple), Masrofi now is using modren technologies, it's a multi-user robust web application for tracking personal expenses. With the ability to manipulate transactions efficiently.


## What is special about Masrofi?
It uses Google generative AI to analyze SMS transaction messages and extract useful information as JSON objects. Then, using these JSON objects, you can filter transactions by date and generate summaries of expenses for any specified time period.
